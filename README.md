## Project Highlights

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I began the project with a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the structure, quality, and behavior of the dataset. Key steps included:

- Cleaning and preprocessing sales data for missing values and anomalies.
- Visualizing sales trends over time across different product categories and regions.
- Identifying patterns such as seasonality, outliers, and correlations.
- Using stacked bar charts and time series plots to compare various industry and job title performance metrics.

This helped me frame the business context and spot initial insights, such as peak sales periods and regional performance variations.

### Time Series Forecasting

To anticipate future demand, I trained and evaluated multiple time series models including:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **Prophet (by Facebook)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)**

Key accomplishments:

- Converted daily job posting data into time-indexed series using Spark and Pandas.
- Visualized weekly trends with labeled peaks and troughs using interactive Plotly charts.
- Applied model diagnostics to evaluate forecasting performance.
- Predicted near-future sales/job posting counts with confidence intervals.

These forecasts provide a reliable foundation for planning inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies.

### Pricing Analysis

I performed pricing analysis to understand the impact of discounts and competition on sales performance. Techniques used:

- Boxplots to examine salary distribution by industry and job title.
- Comparative analysis of full-time vs. part-time employment salary ranges.
- Identification of high-paying sectors with relatively low job demand.
- Investigated relationships between pricing, job roles, and required skills.

This part of the project offered valuable insight into how price points and compensation influence market behavior and hiring trends.

## Outputs

All interactive visualizations were generated using Plotly and exported as `.svg` files for web embedding. The analysis and narrative were compiled into a single HTML dashboard and exported document using Jupyter and `quarto`.
